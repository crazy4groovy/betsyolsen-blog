# I've been there,

## I will help you unlock your own power to get through it

### HI! I AM BETSY OLSEN

I’m a Certified Life Coach, through The Life Coach School. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a mother of 2 awesome boys, and a wife to an amazing man.

I know what it’s like to be so discouraged, unhappy, and desperate that you feel like you’ll never come out of it.

You wonder why you’re there because looking from the outside-in, your life is pretty close to the life you imagined and wanted.

### I love working with moms who are ready to feel better.

They come into my program with just the slightest hope that maybe this will help. It’s fun for me to show them that the change isn’t as difficult or out of reach as they think it is. They learn and understand the reason of WHY they feel so bad, and how to feel better. As they feel better, they become more of who they want to be.

I work one-on-one with clients, so they can open up completely and have a safe place to unload all that is weighing them down. I go through it all with them as they decide what they want to keep and what they don’t. I believe you have the answers inside of you, you just need someone to open up to and believe in you, when you don’t believe in yourself. I am that person. I am that safe space.

If this intrigues you and you’d like to know more, sign-up for a FREE 45-minute Consultation with me. You will have time to tell me what’s going on for you. I’ll give you a personalized action that will help you right now. And if you are a good fit for my program, I will tell you about how to get in.
